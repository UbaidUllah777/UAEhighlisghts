            <p>
                Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan was an Emirati royal, politician, philanthropist and the founder 
                of the United Arab Emirates. Zayed served as the governor of Eastern Region from 1946 until he succeeded 
                Sheikh Shakhbut as the ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966, and then as the first president of the United Arab Emirates
                 while he retained his position as Abu Dhabi's ruler from 1971 until his death in 2004. He is revered in the United
                  Arab Emirates as the Waalid al-Ummah ("Father of the Nation"), credited for being the principal driving force behind 
                  uniting seven emirates.

            <h3>Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan</h3>
            <p>
                Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan was the second president
                 of the United Arab Emirates and the ruler of Abu Dhabi, serving from
                  November 2004 until his death in May 2022.
                  Khalifa was the eldest son of Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the first president
                   of the United Arab Emirates. As crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Khalifa carried out 
                   some aspects of the presidency in a de facto capacity from the late 1990s when his 
                   father experienced health problems.
